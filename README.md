This repository contains the detailed engineering analysis and performance simulation of the RS-25 rocket engine's propellant feed system as part of the final project for MAE 565: Rocket Propulsion at Arizona State University.

📘 Project Overview
The RS-25 engine is a staged-combustion, cryogenic rocket engine originally developed for NASA's Space Shuttle program and currently powering the Space Launch System (SLS). This project focuses on evaluating the fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, and performance of the RS-25's propellant feed system using a combination of theoretical calculations and spreadsheet-based modeling.
